### Welcome to my github

I'm a programming veteran started with x86 assembly on an i386. Since then, I've seen quite a lot of things and technologies coming and going. Currently, I'm focused on efficient build infrastructures/DevOps, IoT, Test Driven Development, C++, Python and Clean Code methodologies.

__⚡ Fun fact__ The nick doclazy came from my first book about programming: "PC-Programmierung in Maschinensprache". The author recommended developing some kind of creative laziness which will drive your code towards high efficiency. Combined with a doctor and voila 😊.
