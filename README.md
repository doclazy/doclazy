### Welcome to my github

I'm a programming veteran started with x86 assembly on an i386. Since then, I've seen quite a lot of things and technologies coming and going. Currently, I'm focused on MBSE, system architecture in safety critical environments, efficient build infrastructures/DevOps, IoT, Test Driven Development, C++, Python and Clean Code methodologies.

__🏭 Professionally, i'm working__ as a software and system architect, currently to build a domain controller ECU in the realm of parking. Besides that I'm a trainer and Valeo expert for C++, Clean Code and Test driven development in safety critical (ISO 26262 / ASIL) and real time systems.

__🔭 Privately, i'm working__ on SmartHome topics and a PV heater 

__🌱 I’m currently learning__ MBSE using Catia NoMagic, Integrating different OS's (QNX,FreeRTOS, AutoSAR) on a multi-core SOC 

__💬 Ask me about__ software development in C++ or Python, DevOps, Software design and architecure or programming in general

__⚡ Fun fact__ The nick doclazy came from my first book about programming: "PC-Programmierung in Maschinensprache". The author recommended developing some kind of creative laziness which will drive your code towards high efficiency. Combined with a doctor and voila 😊.
